# 100 Days of DSA in C

This repository is my **100 Days of Data Structures and Algorithms challenge**, solved using the **C programming language**.

The aim of this challenge is to build strong fundamentals in DSA through **daily practice**, focusing on logic, clarity, and consistency rather than speed.

This work is maintained as part of my **college assignment (Assignment 15)** and reflects my genuine learning process.
