## ✅ Day 11

### Problem: Addition of Two Matrices

**Description:**  
Write a C program to perform addition of two matrices having the same dimensions.  
Each element of the resulting matrix is obtained by adding the corresponding elements  
from the two input matrices.

**Concepts Used:**
- 2D Arrays
- Nested loops
- Matrix operations
- Basic input/output

**File:**  
`Day11.c`

## ✅ Day 12

### Problem: Check Whether a Matrix is Symmetric

**Description:**  
Write a C program to check whether a given matrix is symmetric.  
A matrix is symmetric if it is a square matrix and for every i and j,  
element[i][j] is equal to element[j][i].

**Concepts Used:**
- 2D Arrays
- Nested loops
- Matrix transpose concept
- Conditional statements
- Basic input/output

**File:**  
`Day12.c`

## ✅ Day 13

### Problem: Spiral Traversal of a Matrix

**Description:**  
Write a C program to traverse a rectangular matrix in a clockwise spiral order,  
starting from the outer boundary and moving inward layer by layer  
until all elements are visited.

**Concepts Used:**
- 2D Arrays
- Nested loops
- Boundary traversal technique
- Spiral traversal logic
- Basic input/output

**File:**  
`Day13.c`

## ✅ Day 14

### Problem: Check Whether a Matrix is an Identity Matrix

**Description:**  
Write a C program to check whether a given square matrix is an identity matrix.  
An identity matrix is a square matrix where all diagonal elements are 1  
and all non-diagonal elements are 0.

**Concepts Used:**
- 2D Arrays
- Nested loops
- Matrix properties
- Conditional statements
- Basic input/output

**File:**  
`Day14.c`
