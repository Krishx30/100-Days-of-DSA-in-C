# Day 1 – Day 10

This folder contains my solutions for **Days 1 to 10** of the 100 Days of DSA challenge.

The focus during these days is on:
- Understanding basic array operations
- Learning how logic works in C
- Writing correct and readable code
- Getting comfortable with loops and conditions

---

## ✅ Day 1

### Problem: Insert an Element in an Array

**Description:**  
Write a C program to insert a given element at a specified **1-based position** in an array.  
Existing elements are shifted to the right to make space.

**Concepts Used:**
- Arrays
- Index shifting
- Loops
- Basic input/output

**File:**  
`Day1.c`

## ✅ Day 2

### Problem: Delete an Element from an Array

**Description:**  
Write a C program to delete an element at a specified **1-based position** in an array.  
After deletion, shift the remaining elements to the left.

**Concepts Used:**
- Arrays
- Index shifting
- Loops
- Basic input/output

**File:**  
`day2.c`

## ✅ Day 3

### Problem: Linear Search in an Array with Comparison Count

**Description:**  
Write a C program to search for a given key in an array using linear search.  
The program also counts and displays the number of comparisons performed.  
If the key is found, display the index where it is found; otherwise display Not Found.

**Concepts Used:**
- Arrays
- Linear search
- Loops
- Conditional statements
- Basic input/output

**File:**  
`Day3.c`

## ✅ Day 4

### Problem: Reverse an Array Using Two-Pointer Approach

**Description:**  
Write a C program to reverse a given array of integers in-place using the two-pointer technique.  
The first pointer starts from the beginning of the array and the second pointer starts from the end.  
Elements are swapped until both pointers meet.

**Concepts Used:**
- Arrays
- Two-pointer technique
- Loops
- Basic input/output

**File:**  
`Day4.c`

---
## ✅ Day 5

### Problem: Merge Two Sorted Logs into a Single Chronological Log

**Description:**  
A system receives two separate logs of user arrival times from two different servers.  
Each log is already sorted in ascending order.  
Write a C program to merge both logs into a single chronological log while preserving order.

**Concepts Used:**
- Arrays
- Two-pointer technique
- Loops
- Conditional statements
- Basic input/output

**File:**  
`Day5.c`
